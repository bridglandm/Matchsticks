# Matchsticks

### The Classic Tabletop Game

To play, arrange 15 matchsticks into 3 rows : 3 on the top, 5 in the middle, and 7 on the bottom.

The object of the game is to leave your opponent with the last one.

Players alternate turns, taking any number of matchsticks from one (and only one) row.
